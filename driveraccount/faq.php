                      It really matters and then like it really doesn’t matter. What matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like offended by it, it doesn’t matter. Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I’m here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.

                      The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing out.

                      If everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually succeeds - just the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration.

                      There’s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn’t able to get good at. That’s my skill. I’m not really specifically talented at anything except for the ability to learn. That’s what I do. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t be afraid to be wrong because you can’t learn anything from a compliment.
